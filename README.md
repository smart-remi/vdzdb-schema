In Germany, every magazine or newspaper that is sold has an assigned number, the
VDZ object identifier, that is embedded in its EAN barcode and uniquely
identifies it. However, to get more information about the magazine or newspaper,
a database mapping those identifiers is required. The schema in this repository
describes the structure of this database.
